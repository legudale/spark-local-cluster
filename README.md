### Spark local cluster

If you have docker installed, this allows easily to setup a local cluster
Just run

`docker-compose up -d`

After a minute or two this will start a local Spark cluster on your box with a master and two worker nodes.
The master Web UI is accessible on `http://localhost:8080`
